## [Update]

This is an ongoing issue with the core of parcel, however it can be worked around. You can [manually plug in polyfills](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/2364#issuecomment-445808271) (examples in the link use unpkg), but as some apps won't or can't make use of CDNs, this can be done through post-processing the production build output of parcel, or by making use of [`parcel-lugin-goodie-bag`](https://github.com/edm00se/parcel-plugin-goodie-bag) which I wrote for just this use case. The implementation is simple, as parcel plugins are quite powerful and low/now config, as parcel is. Simply install it as a dev dependency `npm install --save-dev parcel-lugin-goodie-bag` and it will take care of the rest, hooking into your `index.html` on bundle and ensuring a script with said polyfills is included.

# Parcel IE 11 Issue Demo

A quick and dirty demo of behavior of basic app configuration with babel for parcel bundling, and its current issue with IE(11).

Ref: [parcel-bundler/parcel#2364](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/2364).

TL;DR: The multi-bundler loading done by parcel, before the app code even loads, blocks support in IE, as `Promise` and `fetch` are un-polyfilled. Definining a polyfill for my app code doesn't even get loaded yet, since it's done by the [`bundle-loader.js`](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/blob/3042224b8caeb5b195fe64db399be24d3b7ad7cc/packages/core/parcel-bundler/src/builtins/bundle-loader.js#L27-L29).

## Installation

`npm install`

## Usage

- `npm run dev` for development + local server
- `npm run build` for production build to `./dist`

## History

Parcel is an amazing bundler with superpowers. It's focus on low-to-no configuration makes for a great out of the box experience. This is just one hiccup on the way to proper, blissful web development.
